Assignment Prompt:

GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar

Which was a simple few lines of code at the beginning of the .js file. 


WHEN scrolling down,we are presented with time blocks for standard business hours (8AM-5PM)


WHEN I view the time blocks for that day, each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future


WHEN I click into a time block, THEN I can enter an event, WHEN I click the save button for that time block, THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page, THEN the saved events persist. 

This assignment was made easier through the use of imports.
